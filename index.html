            <h1>Why a pet rock?</h1>
            <p><h3>Low Maintenance:</h3> Pet rocks don't need feeding, grooming, or walks. They're the perfect pet for someone with a busy schedule, as they require no care at all.</p>
            <p><h3>No Allergies:</h3> Unlike traditional pets, pet rocks won't trigger any allergies, making them ideal for people who might have sensitivities to fur, dander, or feathers.</p>
            <p><h3>Long Lifespan:</h3> Pet rocks will last forever and don't experience health problems or aging, giving you a lifelong companion.</p>

            <h3>Metamorphic Rock</h3>
            <h1>$10</h1>
            <p>Formed from the transformation of existing rock types under heat and 
                pressure, without melting. Common examples include marble and schist. 
                They often display foliation, or layered textures, due to the alignment 
                of minerals.</p>

            <h3>Sedementary Rock</h3>
            <h1>$10</h1>
            <p>Created from the accumulation and compaction of mineral and organic particles 
               over time. They are often layered and may contain fossils, as seen in sandstone 
               and limestone. These rocks form primarily in water environments like rivers, lakes, and oceans.</p>

            <h3>Igneous Rock</h3>
            <h1>$10</h1>
            <p>Produced by the cooling and solidification of molten magma or lava. They are 
               classified into two types: intrusive (formed underground) and extrusive 
               (formed on the surface), such as granite and basalt. Their texture depends on 
                the cooling rate, with slower cooling creating larger crystals.</p>
